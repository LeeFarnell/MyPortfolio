            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lee Farnell and I am
            currently a student with the University of Birmingham’s Coding Boot
            Camp. Whilst I’m still in the early stages of the Boot Camp, this
            portfolio will be an ongoing evolution of my work and the things I
            have managed to accomplish during my time as a student and beyond.
            I’ve always had an interest in coding and how web pages are designed
            and developed to be able to do the things they do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of the work I have completed so far has given me experience in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>moment.js</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is more to come! Check out some of the projects I have worked
            on below to see what I am capable of.

            This was my first major project as part of the Coding Boot Camp.
            Working in a team with some of the other students, we created the
            Sites and Sounds website. Sites and Sounds allows the user to search
            for any city in the world and search for a venue which will meet
            their needs, be this a restaurant, a park, a gym etc. We pulled the
            data from the foursqaure API to render the cards on the page. We
            also called on the Ticketmaster API which ran as a widget to show
            events happening within the searched location.
          </p>

            My first venture into APIs was with the Weather Dashboard. As part
            of the Coding Boot Camp, we were tasked with created a fully
            functional Weather App, which called on two open weather APIs, to
            pull weather data for whatever city was searched for by the user. We
            also had to show the user a 5 day forecast, the UVI index and also
            icons of what the weather will be like.

            As part of the Coding Bootcamp, I was given a preset HTML and CSS
            page and it was my task to create the javascript element for a
            password generator. It was my responsibility to ensure that the
            necessary criteria from the user story was met. This included having
            alerts and prompts on the page and ensuring that the returned
            password met the criteria set by the user.
