            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lee Farnell and I am
            currently a student with the University of Birmingham’s Coding Boot
            Camp. Whilst I’m still in the early stages of the Boot Camp, this
            portfolio will be an ongoing evolution of my work and the things I
            have managed to accomplish during my time as a student and beyond.
            I’ve always had an interest in coding and how web pages are designed
            and developed to be able to do the things they do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of the work I have completed so far has given me experience in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>Sequelize</li>
            <li>moment.js</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is more to come! Check out some of the projects I have worked
            on below to see what I am capable of.

            This was my second major project as part of the Coding Boot Camp.
            Working in a team with some of the other students, we created P1XEL,
            a new video games based application. P1XEL allows the user to search
            for any video game, regardless of platform, and obtain information
            about the game, as well as screenshots of the game play. The user
            can also create their own profile so that they can log in and store
            games to their digital library, having both a "Have Played" list and
            a "Want To Play" list. The user can also link their Steam account,
            so they can see their recent Steam events, as well as their friends
            recent events, and compare their achievements with their friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this was made possible with the use of two APIs. The first
            being the IGDB (Internet Games Database), where we were able to get
            data from the API and render them into cards, and into their own
            pages, with various information available to the user. We also used
            the Steam API which we linked to the users profile, so they could
            see all of their games, friends and achievements, and also render
            their profile picture to be used as the profile picture for the
            site.

            This was my first major project as part of the Coding Boot Camp.
            Working in a team with some of the other students, we created the
            Sites and Sounds website. Sites and Sounds allows the user to search
            for any city in the world and search for a venue which will meet
            their needs, be this a restaurant, a park, a gym etc. We pulled the
            data from the foursqaure API to render the cards on the page. We
            also called on the Ticketmaster API which ran as a widget to show
            events happening within the searched location.

            My first venture into APIs was with the Weather Dashboard. As part
            of the Coding Boot Camp, we were tasked with created a fully
            functional Weather App, which called on two open weather APIs, to
            pull weather data for whatever city was searched for by the user. We
            also had to show the user a 5 day forecast, the UVI index and also
            icons of what the weather will be like.
